Peer Review comments: Great job Everything is working really well I didn't run into any bugs what so ever. I really like your how clean your code is I like how you organized it. Great work. The only thing is that the visability of your title where is says Weather Forecast March 30, 2024 4:31 PM PDT can be darker so it's more visible cause it gets washed out by the background other than that you app works great.
